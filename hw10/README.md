# HW10: Reinforcement learning introduction

## Link to trained agent video: https://github.com/hoichunlaw/berkeley-w251/tree/master/hw10/video

## Summary

### 1. Training Process

The agent started with random actions, average return fluctuated from 0 to 200 for initial 2500 iterations. After 2500 iterations, the agent started to learn the optimal policy and average return started to go up slowly from 0 to 200. The improvement on average return level off around 10,000 iterations.

### 2. Parameters

By changing fully connected layer size from 100 to 200 then to 300, the performance of agent didn't show a lot of changes, still converge to optimal policy around 10,000 iterations.
