## Part 1 - Image Annotation

### Path to zip file



### Q1: In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?

I annotated all images in 1 hour and 45 minutes.

### Q2: Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters?

302 Millennium Falcon and 273 Tie Fighters.

### Q3: Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?

Performing annotation is very time consumption. If possible, we can design a better workflow for doing annotation. For example, we can design a simple mobile game with task of annotating images.

### Q4: Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?

Image augmentation creates multiple training images from one annotated image. This helps to reduce the time spending on annotating large image sets.

## Part 2 - Image Augmentation

### Q1: Describe the following augmentations in your own words

    -   Flip: mirrors the image around a vertical line running through its center
    -   Rotation: circular movement of images
    -   Scale: change the scale of images
    -   Crop: cut the image
    -   Translation: Move object in the image into different position in the images
    -   Noise: introduce random color pixed into the image

## Part 3 - Audio Annotation

### Q1: Image annotations require the coordinates of the objects and their classes; in your option, what is needed for an audio annotation?

Time start, time end and class.
